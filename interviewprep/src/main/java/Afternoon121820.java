//    //Going over questions from the packet
//    //***STACK VS HEAP
//    //there is a stack that exist, data gets pushed onto that stack. What method to return to gets pushed on to the stack. Used to pass parameters, variables,...all the flow between how you go through a function. This is how java goes through functions.
//    //heap moves where things are in memory. The reference to the table to where it is stored in memory is.
//
//    //this question needs to be readdressed = not asked as data structures. It is how they exist in Java.
//
//    //***WHILE-LOOPS and FOR-LOOPS
//    //the reason that you use a for-loop is that there is a convient structure that you can increment a number of times.
//
//    int k = 0;
//    for(;k< 10; ){
//    k++;
//    }
//    //is the same as saying
//    for(int k=0; k< 10; k++){}
//    //but this is essentially a while loop
////    int j = 0;
////    while(j<10){
////        j++;
//    }
//    //the j scope is bigger than the for loop index scope
//    //for loops can be indeterminant amount of times
////    for(String name = ""; !isValid(name); name=getName()){
//        //this works perfectly fine as well.
////    }
//
//    //*** THROWS VS THROW
//        //the difference is...throws is in the method signature and the throw is in the function.
//        //can throw any checked and unchecked exception.
//        //part of the language specification - compiler will not run through.
//
//        //throws is a definition thing. throws is just saying that this could happen, but it might not even contain that exception
//
//    //STATIC KEYWORD = attaches the method or the data to the class itself but cannot be an instance of it. static means not related to an instance.
//
//        //difference between a class and an object - classes do take up memory, but only some memory. Typical metaphor for a class is a blueprint. Interface is like a contract - whatever meets the contract is good.
//
//    //ABSTRACT CLASS VS INTERFACE
//        //protected vs private - private can be called inside that class however protected - is an access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses.
//
//        //if no naming of the variable then it is package protected.
//
//    //Why wouldn't I want everything public? Data encapsulation. Want to constrain our usability to only the files that need it.
