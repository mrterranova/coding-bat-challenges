    //DEPENDENCY INJECTION EXAMPLE
    //

    //UNDEFINED VS NULL
    //Null is a placeholder and undefined means that a veriable has been declared but there is no placeholder
    //Undefined means that you are referring to something that has never been assigned a value before.

    //null === undefined they are not the same type
    //undefined is false by defined. That is just the language of javascript.

    //VIEW
    //Stored select is what a view is.
    //virtual table - gives us a view of our data
    //Named select that you can write other selects against.

    //div.parent SELECT
    //
